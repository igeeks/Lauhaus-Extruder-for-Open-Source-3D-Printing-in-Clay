# Lauhaus-Extruder-for-Open-Source-3D-Printing-in-Clay
An Open Source 3D print head for printing clay and perhaps other pastes & fluids

Fist of all, many thanks to people who have been pioneering open source 3d printing in clay. Notably Dries Verbruggen of Unfold Studio, Jonathan Keep of the "Build Your Own Ceramic Delta Printer", WASP Project - a 3D printer company based in Italy doing remarkable work, and Richard Horne "RichRap3D" whose open source paste extruder was the first RepRap clay extruder I came across.

The design here draws inspiration and conceptual direction from all of those individuals listed and some others too. This project is interested in making an open source clay extruder for 3d printing. It is intended to be as low-cost as possible and also as easy to assemble and use as possible. Whenever possible, it relies on parts which are widely available or 3d printable. An effort is made to avoid exotic and esoteric and expensive components or things which need to be milled or cast in metal.

This project is being initiated by students of Engineering and students of Art at Penn State University. The project is being led by Tom Lauerman, an artist & teacher with an interest in 3D printing, clay, design, engineering, bicycles, eating ice cream, playing drums poorly, and other activities.
